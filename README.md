# Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my **Python Mini Projects** repository! This collection features small Python projects that demonstrate my skills in various areas, such as algorithms, data structures, web scraping, automation, and more. Each project is designed to showcase my proficiency in Python and provide practical examples of how to solve different programming challenges.

The goal of this repository is to **showcase my work** and provide examples of clean, efficient code. I hope these projects can serve as useful learning tools for anyone interested in Python programming.

## What You Can Do

- **Use the code**: Feel free to use the code in your own personal or educational projects.
- **Fork and clone the repository**: You can fork this repository to create your own version of the project. Once you have your own copy, you can modify the code freely for your own purposes.
- **Commercial use**: You are allowed to use the code for **commercial purposes**, as long as you don’t redistribute it in modified form under this repository.

## What You Can’t Do

- **No modification or redistribution of this repository**: This repository is meant to showcase my work. While you can fork the repository and modify your own copy, **do not modify or redistribute the code** in this original repository.
- **Do not modify the original code here**: Any changes to the code should be made in your own fork, not in this repository. 

I ask that you **keep this repository intact** as a showcase of my original work.

## Projects Overview

This repository will contain various mini-projects, including:

- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Classic examples like sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues).
- **Web Scraping**: Projects that demonstrate how to extract and manipulate data from websites using Python.
- **Automation Scripts**: Tools that automate simple tasks like file management or data collection.
- **Games & Simulations**: Fun Python projects that explore game development and simulations.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Projects that involve data processing, analysis, and visualization using libraries like `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koushikkundu/python-mini-projects.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Projects**:
   Navigate to the project folders to explore and view the code. Each project will have clear instructions on how to run it and any dependencies it requires.

3. **Run the Projects**:
   Each project is a standalone Python script. To run a project, simply execute the main Python file (usually `main.py` or similar):
   ```bash
   python project-name/main.py
   ```

4. **Dependencies**:
   Some projects may require third-party libraries. If so, you’ll find a `requirements.txt` file in the project folder. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
